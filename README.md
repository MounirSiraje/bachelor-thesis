# Bias Detection and Mitigation in Predictive Modelling of Early School Leaving

This repository contains the experimental notebooks, figures, and code used during the development of my thesis on bias detection and mitigation in machine learning pipelines. The use case focuses on predicting students at risk of early school leaving, applying fairness-aware techniques to a real-world educational dataset.

The dataset used is called "Vroegtijdig Schoolverlaten 2022-2023" and can be accessed through the following link: https://onderwijs.vlaanderen.be/nl/onderwijsstatistieken/dataloep-aan-de-slag-met-cijfers-over-onderwijs/download-je-dataset-uit-dataloep#vroegtijdig-schoolverlaten 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This repository includes a variety of exploratory notebooks created throughout the thesis process. Due to time constraints, the code was not consolidated, cleaned, or extensively commented. As a result, the structure may appear fragmented or chaotic at times. Many notebooks were created for isolated testing of specific ideas, figures, or methods.

Despite this, the core logic and results reflect the experiments and analysis presented in the thesis. If you‚Äôre interested in a particular part of the pipeline or experiment, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
